      <description>A new post in blogdown I just copied a blank .Rmd file into the folder /content/post . I gave it a different name than the other post, using the date and some explanatory text (I called it “2017-08-22-new-post.Rmd”).
Then, I added an appropriate YAML heading (similar to the one in the previous post, but changing dates and times).
--- title: &amp;quot;New Post in Blogdown&amp;quot; author: &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; date: 2017-08-22T23:41:14-05:00 categories: [&amp;quot;R&amp;quot;] tags: [&amp;quot;R Markdown&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;blogdown&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;#rstats&amp;quot;] thumbnailImagePosition: left thumbnailImage: .</description>

      <description>The blogdown R package  Finally, -after 24h of failed attempts-, I could get my favourite Hugo theme up and running with R Studio and Blogdown.
After exploring some alternatives, like Shirin’s (with Jekyll), and Amber Thomas advice (which involved Git skills beyond my basic abilities), I was able to install Yihui’s hugo-lithium-theme in a new repository.
However, I wanted to explore other blog templates, hosted in GiHub, like:
 gcushen/hugo-academic jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect and kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme Or this one kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme  The three first themes are currently linked in the blogdown documentation as being most simple and easy to set up for unexperienced blog programmers, but I hope the list will grow in the following months.</description>
