# A new post in <span class="texttt">blogdown</span> 

I just copied a new *.Rmd* file into the folder <span class="texttt"> /content/post </span>. I gave it a different name than the other post, using the date and some explanatory text.  
Then, I added an appropriate YAML heading (similar to the previous post, but changing dates and times).  
Finally I added some content to the Rmarkdown and saved the changes.  

We need to make use of Blogdown & Hugo to compile our *.Rmd* file and create our *html* post:

```{r eval=FALSE}
blogdown::build_site()
blogdown::serve_site()
```

In the viewer, at the right side of the IDE you can examine the resulting *html* and see if something didn't go OK.

# Deploying the site

#### Updating the local <span class="texttt"> git </span> repository

This can be done with simple git commands:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd /Git/[USERNAME].github.io # your path to the repo may be different
git add . # indexes all files that wil be added to the local repo
git commit -m "Adding a new post" # adds all files to the local repo, with a commit message
``` 

#### Pushing to GitHub

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git push origin master # we push the changes from the local git repo to the remote repo (GitHub repo)
``` 

Just go to the page <span class="texttt">https://[USERNAME].github.io</span> and enjoy your new post!
